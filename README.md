# Robotic-Arm-Controller

Built an IC using VHDL that can potentially move a robot. It has the ability to move a robot to a given target position. 
Once the robot reaches that position, the extender feature will be enabled for the user to use. If the arm is extended, the robot can grab things.
If any attempt is made to move the robot to new target position while the arm is extended, an error LED will turn on and it will remain active until the arm is fully retracted.
